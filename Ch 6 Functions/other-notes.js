//how to provide some default values for arguments to a function
//0 can be equivalent to undefined so thus be careful when setting default values as an entry of 0 would be recognized as undefined (which is commonly used for defaulting variables of a function).

// see 06_04
//good idea to insure the input going into function is what you expect (if typeOf !== SOMETHING then return error)
//the end result, passing by reference can be important to modifying the original object/array or if you would rather have a copy back instead.
